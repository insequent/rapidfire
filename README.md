# RapidFire (rf)

RapidFire is a quick command-line tool to make many simulataneous requests to a http endpoint
and report back the results in an easy to read summary. This tool is useful for testing
ratelimiting and tarpitting setups for web servers.

This code is for learning purposes. It has no imports and intentionally relies on stdlib.

NOTE: You may end up being limited by open file/proc limits, depending on your local setup.
